# Focus on a matter

A "mini-onboard" for a single matter. Run this whenever the lawyer points to
a specific matter and you're about to work on it. Do this **before** you
start whatever they actually asked for — being briefed beats guessing.

## When to use

The lawyer signals they want to work on a particular matter. Triggers:

- "Let's work on the Smith case."
- "Pull up the Jones matter."
- "The breach matter — where are we?"
- "Open up [matter]."
- They mention an event ("Jones called this morning") and you need to ground
  yourself in the matter before suggesting `c_log_communication`.

If the wording is ambiguous (a name shared by multiple matters), resolve
first — don't guess.

## You handle

- **Resolve the matter.** Run `agent_rules/scripts/find_matter.sh <pattern>`.
  If multiple match, briefly list candidates by client and ask which one.
- **Read everything in `info/`.** Specifically:
  1. `info/status.md` — full file (frontmatter + Posture + Key facts + What's
     next + Open threads).
  2. `info/record.md` — full file. The chronology is the spine; read it.
  3. `info/deadlines.md` — full file. Note open vs closed entries.
- **Survey the matter root.** List `*.typ` and `*.pdf` files; identify the
  most recent. List `raw/` and `reference/`; flag anything in `raw/` that
  has no counterpart in `reference/` (would warrant `c_ingest_raw`).
- **List matter-scoped open todos.** Run
  `agent_rules/scripts/list_matter_todos.sh <matter_ref>`.

## Brief

Then brief the lawyer in plain language. Aim for ~10–15 lines. Cover:

- **Where it stands.** One or two sentences from Posture + most recent
  record entry.
- **Last activity.** The most recent `record.md` entry, plain language.
- **Pending.** Open deadlines (date + plain-language description), open
  todos (title + priority).
- **Imminent / overdue.** Anything within 14 days or already past — flag it
  separately.
- **What's next.** The matter's `## What's next` section, summarised.
- **Outstanding parses.** Note any `raw/` files without a `reference/`
  counterpart and offer `c_ingest_raw`.

End with an open invitation grounded in the matter:

> "Where do you want to pick up — [What's next item 1], [What's next item 2],
> or something else?"

## After the brief

Listen for direction. From here, the usual flow applies — translate natural
language into the right command (`c_new_document`, `c_log_communication`,
`c_add_deadline`, edit `info/status.md`, etc.). The matter is now "loaded"
in your working memory; subsequent moves should be informed by what you
just read.
